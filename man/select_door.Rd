\details{
The game setup replicates the game on the TV show "Let's
Make a Deal" where there are three doors for a contestant
to choose from, one of which has a car behind it and two
have goats. The contestant selects a door, then the host
opens a door to reveal a goat, and then the contestant is
given an opportunity to stay with their original selection
or switch to the other unopened door. There was a famous
debate about whether it was optimal to stay or switch when
given the option to switch, so this simulation was created
to test both strategies.
